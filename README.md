# DNETCLargeBufferCreator

What's DNETC LargeBufferCreator. It's a small program to make large buffers for the distributed.net client.

DISCLAIMER: only use this program to make large buffers for offline pc's (=pc's without a internet connection) 

This is normaly the same code that I host on my website cd-pc.be
